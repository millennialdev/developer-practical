      - title: 'Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and testing infrastructure'
        completed: false
        description: |
              Set up a new Next.js 15 project in the current directory from scratch.

              IMPORTANT: Ensure git is initialized for this project. If not already set up:
                git init
                git branch -M main
                git remote set-url origin https://github.com/millennialdev/developer-practical.git || git remote add origin https://github.com/millennialdev/developer-practical.git
              If git is already initialized with the correct remote, skip these commands and proceed.

              Then scaffold the Next.js project:
                npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --no-turbopack --import-alias "@/*"
              Accept all defaults when prompted. If it asks about overwriting existing files, say yes.

              After creation, install the only additional dependency:
                npm install lucide-react

              Install test dependencies:
                npm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright
                npx playwright install chromium

              Create testing configuration files:

              1. **vitest.config.ts** — Vitest configuration with React plugin, jsdom environment, @/* path alias, include src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}, globals: true

              2. **src/test-setup.ts** — Import @testing-library/jest-dom/vitest + mock next/image (render as plain <img> element for jsdom compatibility)

              3. **playwright.config.ts** — Set testDir to ./e2e, configure webServer to run 'npm run build && npm run start' on port 3000, define 3 projects: Desktop Chrome, Pixel 5, iPad gen 7

              4. Create directories:
                 mkdir -p e2e scripts

              5. **scripts/test-ci.sh** — Progressive test script:
                 - Always: npm run build && npm run lint
                 - If src/**/*.test.* files exist: npx vitest run --reporter=verbose
                 - If e2e/**/*.spec.* files exist: npx playwright test --reporter=line
                 - Use 'set -e' for fail-fast behavior
                 - Make executable: chmod +x scripts/test-ci.sh

              6. Add to package.json scripts:
                 - "test:ci": "./scripts/test-ci.sh"
                 - "test:unit": "vitest run --reporter=verbose"
                 - "test:e2e": "playwright test --reporter=line"

              Verify the project builds and testing infrastructure is functional:
                npm run build
                npm run test:ci

              The test:ci command should pass (build+lint only, since no test files exist yet).

              Confirm these files exist: src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/app/globals.css, tailwind.config.ts (or postcss.config), tsconfig.json, next.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts, src/test-setup.ts, scripts/test-ci.sh

              Do NOT modify any styling yet. This task is purely scaffolding.

      - title: 'Configure fonts, brand theme, and global styles'
        completed: false
        description: |
              Set up the design system foundation with fonts and brand colors.

              1. Edit src/app/layout.tsx:
                 - Import Outfit and Inter from next/font/google
                 - Outfit config: subsets: ['latin'], weight: ['600','700','800'], variable: '--font-outfit', display: 'swap'
                 - Inter config: subsets: ['latin'], weight: ['400','500','600'], variable: '--font-inter', display: 'swap'
                 - Apply both font variables to the <html> element: className={`${outfit.variable} ${inter.variable}`}
                 - Set metadata:
                   title: "IronPeak Construction Group | Bay Area Construction"
                   description: "Full-service residential and commercial construction in San Jose and the Bay Area. Quality builds, reliable timelines, expert craftsmanship since 2014."

              2. Edit src/app/globals.css. After the Tailwind directives (@tailwind base/components/utilities or @import "tailwindcss"), add custom theme configuration.

                 If using Tailwind v4 (with @import "tailwindcss"):
                 ```css
                 @theme {
                   --color-brand-red: #C41E2A;
                   --color-brand-red-dark: #A01824;
                   --color-brand-black: #1A1A1A;
                   --color-brand-charcoal: #2D2D2D;
                   --color-brand-gray-50: #F8F8F8;
                   --color-brand-gray-100: #F0F0F0;
                   --color-brand-gray-300: #D1D1D1;
                   --color-brand-gray-500: #6B6B6B;
                   --color-brand-gray-600: #4A4A4A;
                   --font-heading: var(--font-outfit), system-ui, sans-serif;
                   --font-body: var(--font-inter), system-ui, sans-serif;
                 }
                 ```

                 If using Tailwind v3 (with tailwind.config.ts), extend the theme there instead:
                 ```ts
                 colors: {
                   brand: {
                     red: { DEFAULT: '#C41E2A', dark: '#A01824' },
                     black: '#1A1A1A',
                     charcoal: '#2D2D2D',
                     'gray-50': '#F8F8F8',
                     // ... etc
                   }
                 },
                 fontFamily: {
                   heading: ['var(--font-outfit)', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
                   body: ['var(--font-inter)', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
                 }
                 ```

                 In globals.css, add base styles:
                 ```css
                 html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }
                 body { font-family: var(--font-body); color: #4A4A4A; }
                 h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-family: var(--font-heading); color: #1A1A1A; }
                 ```

                 Remove ALL default Next.js template styles (the dark mode grid layout, Vercel branding styles, etc.).

              3. Clear src/app/page.tsx — replace with:
                 ```tsx
                 export default function HomePage() {
                   return (
                     <main>
                       <h1 className="text-4xl font-heading font-bold text-center py-20">
                         IronPeak Construction Group
                       </h1>
                     </main>
                   );
                 }
                 ```

              Run npm run build to verify fonts and theme compile correctly.

              Testing note: Build and lint are the meaningful tests for this task. Do not create test files — dedicated Task 5 (UI primitive test suite) will handle all component and constants testing.

      - title: 'Copy logo and create constants and types files'
        completed: false
        description: |
              Set up all static assets and data.

              1. Create image directories and copy the logo:
                 mkdir -p public/images/services
                 cp assets/Logo.png public/images/logo.png

              2. Create src/lib/types.ts with shared interfaces:
                 ```typescript
                 export interface NavLink {
                   label: string;
                   href: string;
                 }

                 export interface Service {
                   title: string;
                   description: string;
                   icon: string;
                   image: string;
                 }

                 export interface FooterLinkSection {
                   title: string;
                   links: string[] | NavLink[];
                 }

                 export interface ProcessStep {
                   number: string;
                   title: string;
                   description: string;
                 }

                 export interface FAQItem {
                   question: string;
                   answer: string;
                 }

                 export interface Stat {
                   value: string;
                   label: string;
                 }
                 ```

              3. Create src/lib/constants.ts with ALL site data (import types from ./types):
                 ```typescript
                 import type { NavLink, Service, FooterLinkSection, ProcessStep, FAQItem, Stat } from "./types";

              4. IMPORTANT — Logo background handling:
                 The logo PNG has a light/white background that will look bad on dark backgrounds (navbar, footer).
                 After copying, check if the logo has transparency. If it has a solid white/light background:
                 - Option A: Use an image processing tool to remove the background (preferred)
                 - Option B: Note this for the Navbar/Footer tasks — the logo should be displayed with appropriate
                   CSS treatment (e.g., a light background padding, or mix-blend-mode) to look clean on dark surfaces.
                 The agent building Navbar (Task 5) and Footer (Task 6) MUST verify the logo renders cleanly
                 on the dark bg-brand-black background and apply CSS fixes if needed (e.g., bg-white rounded p-1,
                 or mix-blend-mode: screen, or adding a light container around it).

              Verify the file compiles: run npm run build.

              Testing note: Build and lint are the meaningful tests for this task. Do not create test files — dedicated Task 5 (UI primitive test suite) will handle all component and constants testing.

                 A centered max-width wrapper.
                 ```tsx
                 interface ContainerProps {
                   children: React.ReactNode;
                   className?: string;
                 }

                 export function Container({ children, className = "" }: ContainerProps) {
                   return (
                     <div className={`mx-auto max-w-7xl px-6 lg:px-8 ${className}`}>
                       {children}
                     </div>
                   );
                 }
                 ```

              2. Create src/components/ui/SectionWrapper.tsx:
                 Every page section wraps in this for consistent spacing and anchor IDs.
                 ```tsx
                 interface SectionWrapperProps {
                   children: React.ReactNode;
                   id?: string;
                   className?: string;
                   background?: "white" | "light" | "dark";
                 }

                 export function SectionWrapper({ children, id, className = "", background = "white" }: SectionWrapperProps) {
                   const bgMap = {
                     white: "bg-white",
                     light: "bg-brand-gray-50",
                     dark: "bg-brand-black text-white",
                   };
                   return (
                     <section id={id} className={`py-16 md:py-20 lg:py-24 ${bgMap[background]} ${className}`}>
                       <Container>{children}</Container>
                     </section>
                   );
                 }
                 ```
                 Import Container from ./Container.

              3. Create src/components/ui/SectionHeading.tsx:
                 Reusable heading block with optional tag and subtitle.
                 ```tsx
                 interface SectionHeadingProps {
                   tag?: string;
                   title: string;
                   subtitle?: string;
                   centered?: boolean;
                   light?: boolean;
                   className?: string;
                 }

                 export function SectionHeading({ tag, title, subtitle, centered = false, light = false, className = "" }: SectionHeadingProps) {
                   return (
                     <div className={`${centered ? "text-center" : ""} ${className}`}>
                       {tag && (
                         <span className={`text-brand-red font-semibold text-sm tracking-widest uppercase font-body`}>
                           {tag}
                         </span>
                       )}
                       <h2 className={`text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-[40px] font-bold font-heading leading-tight ${tag ? "mt-3" : ""} ${light ? "text-white" : "text-brand-black"}`}>
                         {title}
                       </h2>
                       {subtitle && (
                         <p className={`mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed max-w-2xl ${centered ? "mx-auto" : ""} ${light ? "text-gray-300" : "text-brand-gray-500"}`}>
                           {subtitle}
                         </p>
                       )}
                     </div>
                   );
                 }
                 ```

              4. Create src/components/ui/Button.tsx:
                 ```tsx
                 import { ArrowUpRight } from "lucide-react";

                 interface ButtonProps {
                   children: React.ReactNode;
                   variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
                   href?: string;
                   className?: string;
                   showArrow?: boolean;
                   onClick?: () => void;
                 }

                 export function Button({ children, variant = "primary", href, className = "", showArrow = false, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
                   const base = "inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-3.5 font-semibold font-body rounded-md transition-all duration-300 text-[15px] focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-brand-red focus:ring-offset-2";
                   const variants = {
                     primary: "bg-brand-red text-white hover:bg-brand-red-dark hover:-translate-y-0.5",
                     secondary: "border-2 border-brand-red text-brand-red hover:bg-brand-red hover:text-white hover:-translate-y-0.5",
                   };
                   const classes = `${base} ${variants[variant]} ${className}`;

                   if (href) {
                     return (
                       <a href={href} className={classes}>
                         {children}
                         {showArrow && <ArrowUpRight size={18} />}
                       </a>
                     );
                   }
                   return (
                     <button onClick={onClick} className={classes}>
                       {children}
                       {showArrow && <ArrowUpRight size={18} />}
                     </button>
                   );
                 }
                 ```

              5. Create src/components/ui/Card.tsx:
                 A generic, reusable card with image and content slot.
                 ```tsx
                 import Image from "next/image";

                 interface CardProps {
                   image?: string;
                   imageAlt?: string;
                   children: React.ReactNode;
                   className?: string;
                   hoverEffect?: boolean;
                 }

                 export function Card({ image, imageAlt = "", children, className = "", hoverEffect = true }: CardProps) {
                   return (
                     <article className={`group bg-white rounded-lg overflow-hidden border border-brand-gray-100 ${hoverEffect ? "shadow-sm hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300" : ""} ${className}`}>
                       {image && (
                         <div className="relative aspect-[4/3] overflow-hidden">
                           <Image
                             src={image}
                             alt={imageAlt}
                             fill
                             className="object-cover group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-500"
                             sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw"
                           />
                         </div>
                       )}
                       <div className="h-1 w-full bg-brand-red" />
                       <div className="p-6">
                         {children}
                       </div>
                     </article>
                   );
                 }
                 ```

              Run npm run build to verify all components compile.

              Testing note: Do not create test files for these components. The next task (Task 5) is a dedicated testing milestone that will write comprehensive tests for all UI primitives.

      - title: 'Write comprehensive UI primitive test suite'
        completed: false
        description: |
              Dedicated testing milestone for all UI components and constants. This task writes ONLY test files — no component code changes.

              Write Vitest tests for the following files. All test files should be placed next to their source files in src/components/ui/ and src/lib/:

              1. **src/components/ui/Button.test.tsx**:
                 - Renders as <a> element when href prop is provided
                 - Renders as <button> element when href prop is not provided
                 - Applies primary variant styles by default
                 - Applies secondary variant styles when variant="secondary"
                 - Shows ArrowUpRight icon when showArrow={true}
                 - Does not show arrow icon when showArrow={false} or omitted
                 - Calls onClick handler when clicked (button variant)
                 - Navigates to href when clicked (link variant)
                 - Applies custom className correctly
                 - Has focus ring styles (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-brand-red)

              2. **src/components/ui/SectionWrapper.test.tsx**:
                 - Renders children content
                 - Applies section id when provided
                 - Renders with white background by default
                 - Renders with light background when background="light"
                 - Renders with dark background when background="dark"
                 - Applies custom className correctly
                 - Contains Container component

              3. **src/components/ui/SectionHeading.test.tsx**:
                 - Renders title in h2 element
                 - Renders optional tag when provided
                 - Renders optional subtitle when provided
                 - Centers text when centered={true}
                 - Applies light mode styles when light={true}
                 - Applies custom className correctly

              4. **src/components/ui/Card.test.tsx**:
                 - Renders children content
                 - Renders image when provided
                 - Does not render image when not provided
                 - Applies hover effect by default (hoverEffect={true})
                 - Does not apply hover effect when hoverEffect={false}
                 - Renders as article element
                 - Red accent strip (h-1 w-full bg-brand-red) is present
                 - Applies custom className correctly

              5. **src/components/ui/Container.test.tsx**:
                 - Renders children content
                 - Has max-w-7xl class
                 - Has horizontal padding classes (px-6 lg:px-8)
                 - Has horizontal margin auto (mx-auto) for centering
                 - Applies custom className correctly

              6. **src/lib/constants.test.ts**:
                 - SERVICES array has exactly 6 items
                 - Each service has required fields: title, description, icon, image
                 - NAV_LINKS has exactly 4 items
                 - Each nav link has label and href starting with '#'
                 - PROCESS_STEPS has exactly 4 items

                 - FAQ_ITEMS has exactly 6 items
                 - Each FAQ item has question and answer
                 - STATS has exactly 3 items
                 - Each stat has value and label
                 - COMPANY object has all required fields (name, tagline, phone, email, address, founded, serviceArea, heroSubtext, aboutText, aboutText2)
                 - FOOTER_SECTIONS has all 4 subsections (about, industries, usefulLinks, coreServices)

              All tests should use @testing-library/react for component tests and standard Vitest assertions for constants tests.

              After writing tests, verify they all pass:
                npx vitest run --reporter=verbose

              Then verify the full CI suite passes:
                npm run test:ci

              Expected result: All unit tests pass, build succeeds, lint passes. Playwright is skipped (no E2E tests exist yet).

      - title: 'Build the Navbar with mobile hamburger menu'
        completed: false
        description: |
              Create src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx — a sticky dark navigation bar.

              Add 'use client' at the top (uses useState for mobile menu).

              Import: NAV_LINKS from "@/lib/constants", Image from "next/image", { Menu, X } from "lucide-react", Button from "@/components/ui/Button".

              Desktop layout (lg breakpoint and above):
              - Fixed position: fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 bg-brand-black
              - Inner container: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8, flex items-center justify-between, h-20
              - Left: Logo using next/image — src="/images/logo.png", alt="IronPeak Construction Group", height={40}, width={160} (adjust width to be proportional). Add className="h-10 w-auto" for responsive sizing.
                IMPORTANT: The logo may have a non-transparent background. Verify it looks correct on bg-brand-black.
                If it appears with an ugly white rectangle, wrap it in a container with appropriate styling
                (e.g., bg-white/90 rounded px-2 py-1) or use CSS to handle it. The logo must look clean and professional.
              - Center: <nav> with flex gap-8. Map NAV_LINKS to <a> elements with:
                className="text-white text-[15px] font-medium font-body relative after:absolute after:bottom-0 after:left-0 after:h-[2px] after:w-0 after:bg-brand-red after:transition-all after:duration-300 hover:after:w-full hover:text-brand-red transition-colors"
              - Right: Button component — variant="primary", href="#contact", children="Get Free Quote", showArrow={true}
              - Hide nav links and CTA on mobile (hidden lg:flex)

              Mobile layout (below lg):
              - Show hamburger: <button> with <Menu size={24} className="text-white" />, shown on lg:hidden
              - Mobile menu state: const [mobileOpen, setMobileOpen] = useState(false)
              - When open, render a div below the navbar:
                - fixed top-20 left-0 right-0 bottom-0 bg-brand-black/95 z-40 backdrop-blur-sm
                - Flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-6 p-8
                - Nav links stacked vertically: text-white text-xl font-medium, each with py-3
                - "Get Free Quote" Button at bottom
                - X icon at top-right to close
                - Add transition: use conditional className with opacity and translate

              - Close mobile menu when a nav link is clicked (onClick handler that sets mobileOpen to false)
              - Prevent body scroll when mobile menu is open (optional: useEffect to toggle overflow-hidden on body)

              Run npm run build.

              Testing note: When writing tests for this component, focus on smoke tests:
              - Renders logo image
              - Renders all 4 nav links with correct hrefs
              - Renders "Get Free Quote" CTA button
              - Mobile menu opens and closes correctly
              - Mobile menu links close the menu when clicked

        description: |
              Create src/components/layout/Footer.tsx.

              Import: COMPANY, FOOTER_SECTIONS from "@/lib/constants", Image from "next/image", Container from "@/components/ui/Container", { Phone, Mail, MapPin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin } from "lucide-react".

              - <h4 className="font-heading text-lg font-semibold mb-6">{FOOTER_SECTIONS.about.title}</h4>
              - Text: FOOTER_SECTIONS.about.text — text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed
              - Contact items (mt-6, flex flex-col gap-3):
                - Phone icon + COMPANY.phone — flex items-center gap-2 text-gray-400 text-sm hover:text-brand-red transition-colors

              If any URL fails, find a similar construction image from Unsplash.

              Import: SERVICES from "@/lib/constants", SectionWrapper from "@/components/ui/SectionWrapper", SectionHeading from "@/components/ui/SectionHeading", Card from "@/components/ui/Card", { Home, Hammer, Building2, PenTool, Boxes, ClipboardList, ArrowRight } from "lucide-react".

              Create an icon mapping object at the top of the file:
              ```typescript
              const iconMap: Record<string, React.ComponentType<{ size?: number; className?: string }>> = {
                Home, Hammer, Building2, PenTool, Boxes, ClipboardList,
              };

                  Map SERVICES to:

                      return IconComponent ? <IconComponent size={28} className="text-brand-red" /> : null;
                    })()}
                    <h3 className="font-heading text-xl font-semibold text-brand-black mt-3">{service.title}</h3>
                    <p className="text-brand-gray-500 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mt-2">{service.description}</p>

                  ```
                </div>
              </SectionWrapper>

              The icon rendering approach: create the mapping object as shown above so each service's icon string maps to the actual Lucide component. Render it dynamically.

              Run npm run build.

              Testing note: When writing tests for this component, focus on smoke tests:
              - Renders exactly 6 service cards
              - Each card has a title from SERVICES array
              - Section heading "Our Construction Services" is present
              - Each card has a "Learn More" link with href="#contact"

        completed: false
        description: |
              Wire all components together in the main page.

              Update src/app/page.tsx:
              ```tsx
              import { Navbar } from "@/components/layout/Navbar";
              import { Hero } from "@/components/sections/Hero";
              import { About } from "@/components/sections/About";
              import { Services } from "@/components/sections/Services";
              import { Footer } from "@/components/layout/Footer";

              export default function HomePage() {
                return (
                  <>
                    <Navbar />
                    <main>
                      <Hero />
                      <About />
                      <Services />
                    </main>
                    <Footer />
                  </>
                );
              }
              ```

              Verify next.config.ts/next.config.mjs is reasonable — it should NOT have any restrictive image configuration since we're using local images from public/. Remove any experimental flags that might cause issues.

              Run npm run build and fix ALL TypeScript errors. Common issues:
              - Missing 'use client' on components using hooks (Navbar)
              - Import path mismatches (check @/ alias works)
              - Image paths should start with /images/ (files are in public/images/)
              - Tailwind brand-* classes should resolve if the theme is configured correctly in globals.css
              - lucide-react icon name mismatches

              If build passes, run npm run dev and verify the dev server starts on port 3000.

              Testing note: When writing tests for the assembled page, focus on smoke tests in src/app/page.test.tsx:
              - Page renders without crashing
              - All major sections are present (nav, hero, about, services, footer)

        description: |
              Stabilization task. Run npm run build and npm run dev, then verify everything works.

              1. Check all images exist and have non-zero file sizes:
                 ls -la public/images/
                 ls -la public/images/services/
                 For any missing or zero-byte images, re-download replacements from Unsplash using curl.
                 Key images needed:
                 - public/images/logo.png (should already exist from task 3)
                 - public/images/hero-bg.jpg (wide construction site)
                 - public/images/about-workers.jpg (workers reviewing plans)
                 - public/images/services/residential.jpg
                 - public/images/services/remodeling.jpg
                 - public/images/services/commercial.jpg
                 - public/images/services/design-build.jpg
                 - public/images/services/structural.jpg
                 - public/images/services/consulting.jpg

              2. If Tailwind custom colors are not being applied (brand-red, brand-black, etc.):
                 - For Tailwind v4: Check globals.css has @theme { } block with --color-brand-* variables
                 - For Tailwind v3: Check tailwind.config.ts has theme.extend.colors.brand
                 - Test by looking for the CSS output in .next/static/css/

              3. If fonts are not loading:
                 - Verify next/font/google imports in layout.tsx
                 - Check CSS variables --font-outfit and --font-inter are on <html>
                 - Verify globals.css body/heading font-family rules

              4. Fix any remaining TypeScript errors.

              5. Verify: Navbar renders with logo + links, Hero has background image with overlay, About has two columns with image and text, Services shows 6 cards in a grid, Footer has 4 columns + newsletter.

              Run npm run build one final time — must succeed with zero errors.

                 - All nav link hrefs start with '#' (anchor links)
                 - "Get Free Quote" button navigates to #contact
                 - Mobile menu opens when hamburger is clicked
                 - Mobile menu closes when close button is clicked
                 - Clicking mobile nav links closes the menu

              3. **e2e/mobile.spec.ts** — Mobile-specific tests (use mobile viewport):
                 - Hamburger menu button is visible on mobile
                 - Desktop nav links are hidden on mobile
                 - Mobile menu opens and displays all nav links

                 - Services grid adapts correctly (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop)
                 - About section stacks vertically on mobile
                 - Footer columns stack on mobile
                 - Hero buttons stack vertically on mobile
                 - Logo scales appropriately across breakpoints

              5. **e2e/accessibility.spec.ts** — Accessibility tests using @axe-core/playwright:
                 - Run axe-core WCAG 2.0 AA scan on homepage (zero violations)
                 - All images have descriptive alt text
                 - All interactive elements have accessible names
                 - Exactly one h1 element on the page
                 - Sequential heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
                 - All links have href attributes
                 - All buttons have accessible labels

              Configure Playwright tests to run against the built production site (npm run build && npm run start).

              After writing tests, verify they all pass across all 3 projects (Desktop Chrome, Pixel 5, iPad):
                npx playwright test --reporter=line

              Then verify the full CI suite passes:
                npm run test:ci

              Expected result: All E2E tests pass across all 3 browser projects, unit tests pass, build succeeds, lint passes.

              Review and refine responsive behavior. Check all Tailwind responsive classes.

              NAVBAR (src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx):
              - Mobile (< lg): Hamburger visible, nav links hidden, mobile menu works
              - Logo: h-8 on mobile, h-10 on desktop (sm:h-10)
              - Ensure mobile menu covers full screen and has close button
              - Nav links in mobile menu should close the menu when clicked

              HERO (src/components/sections/Hero.tsx):
              - Mobile: text-3xl sm:text-4xl (heading), text-base (subtext)
              - pt-20 on mobile for fixed navbar offset
              - Buttons: flex-col on mobile (full width), flex-row on sm+
              - Make buttons w-full sm:w-auto if not already
              - min-h-[80vh] sm:min-h-screen to prevent overly tall hero on small phones

              ABOUT (src/components/sections/About.tsx):
              - Mobile: Single column, image comes first naturally
              - Image: aspect-[4/3] on mobile, aspect-[4/5] on lg
              - Stats: On very small screens, ensure they don't overflow. Consider flex-wrap
              - Decorative red square: hidden on mobile (hidden lg:block)

              SERVICES (src/components/sections/Services.tsx):
              - grid-cols-1 on mobile, md:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3
              - Cards should have consistent heights: add h-full to Card, flex flex-col on content area, flex-grow on description
              - Gap: gap-6 on mobile, gap-8 on desktop

              FOOTER (src/components/layout/Footer.tsx):
              - grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
              - Newsletter input: w-full on mobile, md:w-64 on desktop
              - Social icons: justify-center on mobile, justify-end on desktop
              - Copyright: text-center on mobile

              GLOBAL:
              - Add overflow-x-hidden to the body or html element to prevent horizontal scroll
              - Ensure all touch targets >= 44x44px (check mobile nav links, buttons, social icons)
              - No text smaller than 13px on mobile

              Run npm run build after making changes.

              Add professional polish to elevate the design quality.

              1. SCROLL ANIMATIONS:
                 Create src/hooks/useScrollAnimation.ts:
                 ```typescript
                 "use client";
                 import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

                 export function useScrollAnimation(threshold = 0.1) {
                   const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
                   const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

                   useEffect(() => {
                     const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
                       ([entry]) => {
                         if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                           setIsVisible(true);
                           observer.unobserve(entry.target);
                         }
                       },
                       { threshold }
                     );
                     if (ref.current) observer.observe(ref.current);
                     return () => observer.disconnect();
                   }, [threshold]);

                   return { ref, isVisible };
                 }
                 ```

                 Add CSS keyframe in globals.css:
                 ```css
                 @keyframes fadeInUp {
                   from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(24px); }
                   to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
                 }
                 ```

                 Apply to About and Services sections: wrap content in a div with ref from useScrollAnimation, and conditionally apply the animation:
                 className={`transition-all duration-700 ${isVisible ? "opacity-100 translate-y-0" : "opacity-0 translate-y-6"}`}

                 For service cards, add staggered delays: style={{ transitionDelay: `${index * 100}ms` }}
                 Mark About.tsx and Services.tsx as 'use client' if they now use the hook.

              2. HOVER MICRO-INTERACTIONS (verify these exist):
                 - Service cards: image scale on hover (group-hover:scale-105) ✓ (from Card component)
                 - Service "Learn More": arrow gap transition (hover:gap-3) ✓
                 - Nav links: underline grow animation (after pseudo) ✓
                 - Buttons: subtle lift (hover:-translate-y-0.5) ✓
                 - Footer links: color transition ✓

              3. VISUAL POLISH:
                 - Verify the red accent strip on service cards renders (h-1 bg-brand-red in Card)
                 - Verify consistent section spacing (SectionWrapper handles py-16/20/24)
                 - Verify font-heading applied to ALL headings (h1-h6)
                 - Verify font-body applied to body text
                 - Check color contrast: white on #C41E2A = 4.63:1 ratio (passes AA for large text)

              4. PERFORMANCE:
                 - Hero image should have priority prop on next/image
                 - Service images should have proper sizes attribute
                 - Verify no layout shift (images have explicit dimensions or aspect ratios)

              Run npm run build.

              4. Remove unused imports and commented-out code
              5. Verify file structure matches the architecture:
                 src/components/ui/ — Button, Container, SectionWrapper, SectionHeading, Card
                 src/components/layout/ — Navbar, Footer

                 e2e/ — All Playwright test specs
                 scripts/ — test-ci.sh
              6. Ensure .gitignore includes: node_modules, .next, .env*, test-results/, playwright-report/
              7. Create README.md with:
